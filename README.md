# Vehicle Registration Dashboard

This project is an interactive dashboard designed to visualize vehicle registration data, focusing on key metrics relevant to investors, such as Year-over-Year (YoY) and Quarter-over-Quarter (QoQ) growth.

This project is structured as a monorepo with separate `frontend` (Next.js) and `backend` (Python script) directories for clearer separation of concerns.

## Features

- **Vehicle Type-wise Data:** Visualize registrations for 2-Wheelers (2W), 3-Wheelers (3W), and 4-Wheelers (4W).
- **Manufacturer-wise Data:** Track registration trends for various vehicle manufacturers.
- **Growth Metrics:** Display calculated YoY and QoQ growth percentages for overall and specific categories/manufacturers.
- **Interactive Filters:**
  - **Date Range Selection:** Choose a custom period to analyze data.
  - **Category/Manufacturer Filters:** Drill down into specific vehicle types or manufacturers.
- **Trend Graphs:** Line and Bar charts to illustrate registration trends over time.
- **Responsive UI:** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a modern and adaptable user experience.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
  - [React](https://react.dev/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
  - [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) for UI components
  - [Recharts](https://recharts.org/) for charting (integrated via shadcn/ui Chart components)
  - [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/icons/) for icons
- **Backend/Data Processing:**
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) for data scraping (simulated) and calculation of growth metrics.
  - Next.js API Routes (within the frontend) to serve processed data from the Python script.

## Data Source

For demonstration purposes, this project uses **synthetic data** generated by a Python script (`backend/process_data.py`).

**Note on Vahan Dashboard Data:**
Accessing public data from the Vahan Dashboard typically involves web scraping. This can be complex due to dynamic content loading (JavaScript), CAPTCHAs, and rate limiting. A robust solution would likely require libraries like `Playwright` or `Selenium` in Python to interact with the page like a browser, or investigating if the dashboard provides a public API. For this project, the Python script simulates data to focus on the dashboard's functionality.

## Installation and Setup Guide

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Python (v3.8 or higher)

**Gti-clone**

```bash
https://github.com/vishnuu5/Vehicle-Registration-Dashboard.git
```

### Steps

1.  **Download the Code:**
    If you're viewing this in a code block, you can use the "Download Code" button. Extract the downloaded `.zip` file. You will find `frontend/` and `backend/` directories inside.

2.  **Navigate to the Project Root:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the **root directory** of the extracted project (the folder containing both `frontend` and `backend`).

```bash
cd path/to/your/vehicle-registration-dashboard
```

3.  **Set up Frontend Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `frontend` directory and install Node.js dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

4.  **Set up Backend (Python) Dependencies:**
    Navigate into the `backend` directory. It's highly recommended to create a Python virtual environment here to manage dependencies.

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

    # On Windows (Command Prompt):
    # venv\Scripts\activate.bat

    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # For this project, no external Python libraries are strictly required.
    # If you were to add libraries like pandas or requests, you would install them here:

    # pip install pandas requests

    cd .. # Go back to the project root
```

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    From the **project root directory**, you will start the Next.js development server.

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

    The dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

    The Next.js API route (`frontend/app/api/data/route.ts`) will automatically execute the Python script (`backend/process_data.py`) when data is requested by the frontend.

**Initialize Git and Push to GitHub:**
Ensure your entire project (including both `frontend` and `backend` folders) is committed and pushed to a GitHub (or GitLab/Bitbucket) repository.

```bash
    # From your project root (containing frontend/ and backend/)

    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit with frontend/backend structure"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
    git push -u origin main
```
